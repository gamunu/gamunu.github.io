GPG can be used to create a digital signature for both Debian package files and for APT repository metadata.

Many Debian-based Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu) have GPG signature verification of Debian package files (.deb) disabled by default and instead choose to verify GPG signatures of repository metadata and source packages (.dsc). The setting which enables GPG signature checking of the individal .deb packages can be found in /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg and is set to no-debsig, but there are important caveats to enabling this option explained below.

Further, most official Debian package files from the publicly accessible repositories do not have GPG signatures. The official repository metadata is GPG signed, as are the source packages, but the .deb packages themselves are not.

If you publish a Debian package and GPG sign the package yourself before distributing it to users, those users’ systems will, in most cases, not verify the signature of the package unless they have done a considerable amount of configuration. However, their system will, in most cases, automatically verify repository metadata.

This post explains how Debian package GPG signatures are implemented, how to enable GPG signature checking of packages on your system, and how to GPG sign packages you create.

This post will also explain how APT repository GPG signatures are implemented and how to sign your APT repository metadata.

## Debian package GPG signatures

Signing data with a GPG key enables the recipient of the data to verify that no modifications occurred after the data was signed (assuming the recipient has a copy of the sender’s public GPG key).

Debian package files (.deb files), Debian source packages (.dsc files), and Debian changes files (.changes files) can all be signed with GPG.

## GPG signing Debian source packages (.dsc files) and changes files

Debian source packages and Debian changes files are text-based files which can be used to rebuild a Debian package from source code. Theses files can be signed with a GPG key by using a program called `debsign`.

debsign will add a GPG signature to .dsc and .changes files themselves. You can use debsign like this:

```bash
$ debsign -k E732A79A test_1.0-7.dsc
```
This command specifies the GPG key ID to use when signing the Debian source file `test_1.0-7.dsc`. The signature is embedded in the file `test_1.0-7.dsc` and can be verified by running:

```bash
$ gpg --verify test_1.0-7.dsc
```
The Debian source package file and changes file both contain SHA1, SHA256, and MD5 checksums of all source files that comprise the source package. Since this data is signed, any modifications to the source file checksums, file size, or other data in the dsc or changes files would cause signature verification to fail.

As long as a recipient who wishes to build the deb package from a dsc file verifies the checksums of each file in the source package and verifies the signature of the source package itself, the recipient knows their build uses precisely the same files that the packager used when building.

`apt-get source packagename` will automatically check the GPG signature of the source package file and the checksums of the source files listed in the source package.

## GPG signing Debian package files (.deb files)

A Debian package file itself is actually an AR archive that contains at least three entries:

> `debian-binary`: a file describing the deb format version
> `control`: an archive containing package metadata such as pre-install or post-install scripts
> `data`: an archive containing the actual installable files
The `control` and `data` archives are typically `tar`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, `tar.xz`, `tar.lzma`, or another archive format.

When a Debian package is signed with a GPG key, the signature is also included in the archive and is named based on its type.

Debian package signatures are typically associated with a role. Some commonly used roles include:

> `origin`: the signature of the organization which distributes the .deb file
> `maint`: the signature of the package maintainer
> `archive`: the signature of the archive providing the package to reassure users that the package is the actually provided by the archive
> In order to sign a Debian package, you can use the program `debsigs`:

```bash
$ debsigs --sign=origin -k E732A79A test_1.0-7_amd64.deb
```
In the above example, the Debian file is signed using the GPG key on my system with the ID E732A79A. The signature type is `origin` and thus the deb package will be modified to include a file called `_gpgorigin` that contains the GPG signature of the `debian-binary` file, `control` archive, and `data` archive from the deb package concatenated together.

I used the type origin because I am person distributing the deb package test_1.0-7_amd64.deb.

Verifying signatures on Debian .deb package files is a bit more involved than the other verification methods.
